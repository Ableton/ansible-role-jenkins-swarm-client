# On some Unix versions, we can run into trouble when trying to run usermod when a
# background task owned by the Jenkins user is running (specifically, on systems with
# newer versions of systemd running). For that reason we see if the user exists and then
# only create it if necessary.
# This means that the Jenkins user should *not* be created independently of Ansible,
# otherwise the other user attributes below will not be properly set.
